Zone mode
=========

ObjectViz can limit object detection to specific zones, you can use the `zones`
mode (from the menu) to configure them. If no zone is configured, objects will
be recognized in all parts of the screen in `use` mode.


Creating zones
--------------

Any long touch on the detection zone in `zones` mode, will create a new zone,
centered around the touch.
