Profiles
========

Multiple profiles (object and zone calibrations) can be saved separately,
allowing to use with multiple sets of objects/applications.

Saving
------

To save the current configuration, touch the `save` button in the menu. The
dialog that opens allow to either select an existing profile, or to create one
by typing a different name.
